\section{Data extract and grooming}
Statutory catch, effort and landings data for GUR 2 from the beginning of the 1990
fishing year (1 October 1989), to the end of the \Sexpr{fyr} fishing year (30 September \Sexpr{fyr})
were sourced from the Ministry for Primary Industries' \texttt{warehou} database.
The dataset captured all fishing effort in FMA 2 that had potential to capture
gurnard (inshore trawls in Statistical Areas 011:016) regardless of whether gurnard
was captured.
Data were groomed within Trident's \texttt{kahawai} database which implements grooming
methods described by \citet{starr2007} using code adapted from the Groomer
package \citep{bentley2012}.


The landings data was groomed using the checks suggested by Starr (2011) as implemented in
the groomer software. The check LADTH, which removes landings held on board or
on land, had the largest impact although LADUP which identifies duplicate
landings was also influential early in the time series (\autoref{fig:deleted_landings}).
The resulting groomed landing data displayed good correspondence with the QMR/MHR
data in each QMA (\autoref{fig:groom_sum}).

The configuration of the aggregated CPUE data set summarised effort records for
each vessel fishing day followed the approach of \citet{langley2014}. For each
fishing day, the following variables were derived: the number of trawls, total
fishing duration (hours), the predominant target species and the predominant
Statistical Area where fishing occurred. The estimated catches of all species
were also determined for each fishing day. For comparability with the CELR data
format, only the estimated catch of the five main species (by catch magnitude)
were retained in the final aggregated data set. In the first instance, the landed
catches of the species of interest from individual trips were allocated amongst
the associated aggregated event records in proportion to the (daily aggregated)
estimated catch of the species. In the absence of the species being included
within the daily aggregated estimated catch, the landed catch was allocated in
proportion to the fishing effort (number of trawls) within the fishing trip.
